## Regression tests for buffergen() (Hagens and Middelburg, 2016).
##
## What these tests protect against
##   1. A wrong sign in the derivative terms of the fluoride and sulfate systems
##      (the 3.4.1 code had both reversed), which made RF wrong by 5 to 20 ppm.
##   2. Counting HSO4 (or HF) as a separate alkalinity term on a pH scale where it
##      is already part of the definition of [H+].
##   3. Returning plausible looking numbers for derivatives that are not defined on
##      a given pH scale. Those outputs must be NA.
##
## How the tests are independent of buffergen()
##   Test 4 does not call any buffergen formula. It rebuilds the total alkalinity
##   of each pH scale from the species concentrations that carbfull() returns, and
##   obtains every derivative by NUMERICAL partial derivatives of that alkalinity
##   (implicit function theorem). Only the equilibrium constants are taken from
##   carbfull()'s own species (K = [H+][base]/[acid]), so a bug in the derivative
##   algebra of buffergen() cannot hide behind a copy of the same algebra.
##
## Alkalinity on each pH scale (what carbfull() solves; same as SolveSAPHE):
##   free  (F):  ... + [OH-] - [H+]F - [HSO4-] - [HF]
##   total (T):  ... + [OH-] - [H+]T - [HF]      ([HSO4-] is inside [H+]T)
##   SWS:        ... + [OH-] - [H+]SWS           ([HSO4-] and [HF] are inside [H+]SWS)
##
## Settings: k1k2 and kf are always passed explicitly. Their defaults ("x") switch
## formulation silently outside certain ranges (see CLAUDE.md).
## Tolerances are not to be widened to make a failing test pass.

## The helpers (GRID, bg(), indep(), d1(), relerr()) are in helper-buffergen.R.
